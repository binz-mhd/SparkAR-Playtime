# Spark AR-Playtime
This is a repository of files included in my SparkAR Playtime Challenge Project

Spark AR competitions give you the chance to connect with the Spark AR community and turn your creativity into cash prizes. Entrants submit effects inspired by a specific theme or capability, which are judged based on craftsmanship, originality and user engagement.

Remember, a large audience of followers will only get you so far in our competitions â€” effects are also judged on originality, technical complexity and craftsmanship. Making your effect unique, engaging and shareable is the key to success.
